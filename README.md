# backend-task

A task for backend developers.

This is small program with a logical error in the implementation of some logic.

This is meant to demonstrate some familiarity with:
* Git/Github
* Python/Go/Javascript (Java TBD)
* Setting up an environment to run/test a program
* Working with data (in this case two csv files)
* Identifying logical errors

## Steps for a solution

1. Work out how to download/clone the repo
2. Work out how to run the program (all the files necessary are in this repo)
3. Look at any documentation to work out the correct operation
4. Compare the actual output with the expected output
5. Identify the bug(s)
6. Fix the bug(s)!
7. Identify how to avoid this bug(s) in future.
6. For bonus points, how would you improve this function's performance?


## Requirements

One of:
* Python 3+
* Go or
* Node
* Java (TBD)
