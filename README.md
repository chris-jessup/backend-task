# backend-task

A task for backend developers.

This is small program with a logical error in the implementation of some logic.

This is meant to demonstrate some familiarity with:
* Git/Github
* Python
* Setting up an environment to run/test a program
* Working with data (in this case two csv files)
* Identifying logical errors

## Steps for a solution

1. Work out how to download/clone the repo
2. Work out how to run the program (all the files necessary are in this repo)
3. Look at any documentation to work out the correct operation
4. Compare the actual output with the expected output
5. Identify the bug
6. (optional) Fix the bug!
7. Identify how to avoid this bug in future.
6. (BONUS POINTS!) How would you improve this function's performance?

## Things we do and don't care about
We don't necessarily care that you are able to solve the bug in the program, we are more interested in your ability
to demonstrate familiarity with the tools of the trade

## Requirements
* Python 3+
